# misago-users-online-plugin

This repository contains an example [Misago](https://misago-project.org) forum software plugin that adds users online list to the forum, created using the [plugin development tutorial](https://github.com/rafalp/Misago/blob/main/dev-docs/plugins/tutorial.md) from Misago's developer documentation.

Please note that plugin's implementation of the online users feature is _naive_. This plugin will be a performance bottleneck if used on all but the smallest forums.
